        <p>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in

           cook until golden, about 1 minute. Pour milk slowly into the saucepan, stirring 
           continuously. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until sauce begins to bubble, 7 to 8 
           minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
        <p>Remove saucepan from heat. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in Parmesan cheese. Pour 
           sauce over cooked tortellini in the baking pan.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until sauce begins to brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve 
           immediately.</p></li>
