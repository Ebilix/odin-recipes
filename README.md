# odin-recipes
My first Odin Project!

The purpose of the project is to practice and apply HTML foundational knowledge acquired.

I was able to build a simple recipe website by applying the following:
- Elements and tags
- HTML boilerplate
- Working with texts (how to create paragraphs, headings, bold text, italicized text, etc)
- Ordered and unordered lists
- Links and images

It was an exciting time because I was able to have a feel of what was behind the GUI when one is using a web browser.
